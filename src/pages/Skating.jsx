                  Skateboarding is more than just a hobbyâ€”it&apos;s a mindset that has shaped
                  my approach to design. The balance and flow required in skateboarding
                  are the same principles I apply when designing user interfaces. I
                  often draw parallels between navigating obstacles on a board and
                  overcoming design challenges in my work. In this section, I explore
                  how skateboarding helps me build interfaces that feel intuitive,
                  balanced, and natural, much like a well-executed trick on a
                  skateboard.

                  Skateboarding forces you to think outside the box, whether it&apos;s
                  figuring out how to land a new trick or finding a creative path
                  through an urban environment. This creativity has fueled my innovation
                  in tech, allowing me to think beyond conventional solutions when
                  tackling design problems. In this section, I share examples of how the
                  unpredictability and challenges of skateboarding have inspired
                  breakthrough ideas in my tech projects. I think skating teaches
                  persistence and promotes a good sense of risk assessment and risk
                  management. All skills that I think help us to reach good design!
