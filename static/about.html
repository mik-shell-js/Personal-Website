        </div>
        <div class="content-paragraph">
        <p>
            I am Michel Adelien, a Posse Scholar and a full-time student at Cornell University, majoring in Information Science with concentrations in UI/UX Design and Data Science and Analytics, alongside a minor in Game Design. My passion lies at the intersection of technology, inclusivity, and creativity, ensuring that emerging technologies foster an equitable digital world. My journey started in high school, where I saw firsthand how tech could drive social change, and since then, I have committed to making the field more diverse, inclusive, and innovative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Raised in Chicago with roots in Haiti, I bring a unique cultural perspective that fuels my advocacy for DEI in the tech industry. I am an active member of ColorStack and a strong advocate for ensuring that marginalized voices have a place in technology. Beyond academics and activism, I enjoy skateboarding, which deeply influences my approach to design and problem-solving. The creativity, adaptability, and resilience required in skateboarding reflect my philosophy in tech—breaking barriers and redefining possibilities.

        </div>
        <div class="content-paragraph">
        <p>
            This platform was created to serve as a convergence of my passions—technology, DEI advocacy, and skateboarding culture. Here, I share my insights, research, and projects aimed at fostering a more inclusive tech industry. Through blog posts, portfolio showcases, and tech-related discussions, I hope to inspire, educate, and connect with others who share similar values and interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website also functions as a personal portfolio, highlighting my work in UI/UX design, data analytics, and game design, while also offering a unique space to explore the parallels between skateboarding and technology. By weaving together these elements, I strive to build a digital environment that is as dynamic and boundary-pushing as the fields I am passionate about.
