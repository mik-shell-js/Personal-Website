                <p>
                    In the future, I plan to design an app that prioritizes accessibility for users with a wide range of abilities. My goal is to incorporate voice navigation, high-contrast visuals, and customizable user interfaces, ensuring that the app serves as a model for inclusive design. By working closely with disability advocates and conducting user testing, I aim to ensure that this app will meet the diverse needs of its users. This project will serve as an example of how technology can break down barriers and promote digital inclusion.

                <p>
                    I am eager to dive into data analysis projects that focus on examining diversity metrics across tech companies. My future work will involve analyzing key factors like gender representation, racial diversity, and inclusion efforts within large tech organizations. By visualizing this data through interactive dashboards, I hope to uncover insights that can drive meaningful change in hiring practices and workplace policies. This project will help raise awareness about the importance of diversity in the tech industry and inform strategies for improvement.

                    Looking ahead, I plan to create a virtual world that emphasizes inclusivity and representation. This future project will involve designing a gaming experience where players of all backgrounds and abilities can feel represented and engaged. I intend to focus on creating accessible gameplay features, including customizable controls and visual elements that cater to a diverse audience. By collaborating with game developers and inclusive design experts, I hope to bring this vision of an inclusive virtual world to life.
